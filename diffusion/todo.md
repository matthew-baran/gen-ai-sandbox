* Change imports to use full namespace whenever practical
* Centralize configuration parameters and minimize globals
* Put noise generator calcs into a function
* Add model re-load capability for continued learning
* Plot training data at training resolution, not native resolution
* Evaluate noise schedule for potential change to non-linear
* Assess for code clean-up - variables names, clear implementations, etc.
* Linting and formatting
